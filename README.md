# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects

Welcome to my repository of personal projects in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. This repository contains various projects categorized into folders based on different topics such as classification, clustering, deep learning, and recommendation systems. Each folder contains Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) showcasing different analyses and implementations.

## Folder Structure
The repository is organized into the following folders:

1. **Classification**


2. **Clustering**


3. **Deep Learning**


4. **Recommendation System**


## Installation
To run the notebooks in this repository, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. You can install the required libraries using the following steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-dl-projects.git
   cd ml-projects
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

2. Install the required libraries if requirementx.txt available:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To explore the projects, follow these steps:

Navigate to the desired folder (e.g., classification, clustering, deep learning, or recommendation system).
Open the Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) of interest using Jupyter Notebook:
bash
jupyter notebook
Run the cells in the notebook to see the analysis and results.
