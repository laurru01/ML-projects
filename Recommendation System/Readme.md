# Newsletter Content Recommendation System

## Project Description
The Newsletter Content Recommendation System aims to optimize the engagement of Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) with newsletters by recommending personalized content. The system increases the volume of sales of Pharma company products by focusing on the 'Message_click' rate, under the hypothesis that a higher click rate correlates positively with prescription rates. The project leverages a hybrid recommendation system, combining collaborative and content-based filtering methods, to tailor newsletter content to individual HCP preferences, potentially driving long-term sales growth.
